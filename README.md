# Welcome to my project demonstration, NewsExplorer

Technologies and techniques used in this project includes:

Javascript
React
Redux
Authorization and authentication

HTML and CSS - in collaboration with Redux, demonstrates the use of state specific js design allowing a contrast between light and dark theme for two separate pages with similarly displayed components.

Implementation of a third-party API with asynchronous fetch requests - this data will be viewed into organized news cards, which will give the user option to save selected news cards from an array of articles in a separate react component that is on the user's separate profile page. Options to delete cards will also be available to user.

Search-query-specific Api - Interaction with online NewsAPI will provide live article viewing. The following information as per search will be included in each newscard: article title, published date, article description, source, and image url.

Responsive design - use of media queries for adaptive screen design for atleast 3 screen orientations(computer, tablet and mobile). Menu options converted from header buttons to hamburger menu.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
